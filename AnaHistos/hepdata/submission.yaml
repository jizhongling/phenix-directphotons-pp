  BNL-RHIC. We present the measurement of the cross section and double helicity asymmetry $A_{LL}$ of direct photon production in $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV. The measurement has been performed at midrapidity ($|\eta| <$ 0.25) with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Direct photons are dominantly produced by the quark-gluon scattering at relativistic energies. Since direct photons are produced from the initial partonic hard scattering and do not interact via the strong force, this measurement provides a clean and direct access to the gluons in the polarized proton in the gluon momentum fraction range 0.02 $< x <$ 0.08.
